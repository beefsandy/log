met with jenna for burgers, talked about the crazy shit, this broke ass disk and spooky thumbdrive

Almost sarcastically in response to **operation git init**, hooked me up with an earpiece, hypersecure
end to end encryption

the floppy disk seems to have a bunch of financial records, indicating several locations of potential
labs

visited the first location with rabbit man, find a strange piece of technology able to painlessly incorporate itself into my biology

You have a level 1 air filter.
You have a 10 minute storage of compressed air in your throat that you can use to breathe, even in a
vacuum.

message jenna on secure line, these people are making MAX-compatible devices.

the thumbdrive is more complicated than she thought, will take some time.

one shot and affinity (and shimmer) meet and talk about the suppressant and stimulants that were given
to junior heros and other kidnapees at the laboratory. golden aura affinity sensed was likely the
stimulant surrounded by suppressant in their systems.
