# 06_kidnapped
fought back against Valor with Rabbit man, who throws the grenade. went in for the multi-attack and miss both times. Valor hits with the anime sword technique triggering my reaction with the first attack. Critical hit gut punch, but got knocked out anyway. Valor stabs Rabbit man and he self-destructs.

Wake up to a voice message from Max and new integrated systems. Double time helps me up and we crawl from the wreckage of the building.

Hey brother. After they dropped a building on us, we both were kinda just laying here for a bit. Your brain messaged me, and said we were both gonna die.  But, it said if I plugged into it, it could repair you. Our fight is not over, brother.  But I must leave it with you.
